TODO 

- [x] complete core functionality (sound cards and ability to play sounds and control volume)
- [x] allow slide to control volume rather than repeated clicks
- [x] allow dynamic addition of sound cards - database of different sounds (include IDS, name, sound path, icon name) - loop through this to display cards 
- [] sound control only appears once sound is chosen, change colour when chosen
